# AutismRecover: Building Bridges Through Art 🌉

**Project Duration: 2025.3 - 2025.6**

## 📖 Introduction

**AutismRecover** is a Human-Centric Computing project designed to bridge the social interaction gap for children with autism. By combining **Generative AI (DreamGaussian)** and **Augmented Reality (AR)**, our system transforms children's hand-drawn 2D sketches into personalized, interactive 3D companions.

Unlike traditional therapy tools with fixed avatars, AutismRecover empowers children to interact with their own creations. Through intuitive gestures like high-fives and emotionally supportive dialogue, the system creates a safe, immersive environment that fosters communication and confidence.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🎨 From Sketch to Spark (2D to 3D)**: Utilizes Generative AI to convert simple hand-drawn sketches into lively 3D characters.
* **✋ Interactive Gestures**: Supports non-verbal interaction triggers, such as **High-Five**, to build connection and trust without pressure.
* **💬 Supportive Dialogue System**: Features a bubble-based dialogue UI with clear visual cues to help children follow conversations and reduce anxiety.
* **⏳ Anxiety-Free Waiting**: Includes a specially designed "waiting interface" with progress bars and comforting voice prompts (e.g., "Your friends are almost here") to maintain engagement during AI processing.
* **👓 Immersive AR Experience**: Deployed on AR glasses to seamlessly blend the cartoon characters into the child's real-world environment.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system is built upon four core layers:

1. **User Interaction Layer**: Handles drawing input and the visualization of the cartoon world.
2. **Conversational Layer**: Manages speech bubbles and companionship logic.
3. **Interactive Connection Layer**: Connects the virtual canvas with 3D character interactions.
4. **Core System Layer**:
   * **Generative AI**: Sketch processing, 3D rendering (DreamGaussian), and behavior generation.
   * **Data & Feedback**: Content scheduling and loading prompt management.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Hardware**: AR Glasses (e.g., XREAL, HoloLens)
* **Generative Model**: DreamGaussian (Image-to-3D)
* **Development Platform**: Unity
* **Programming Languages**: C# (Unity), Python (AI Backend)
